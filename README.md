# MachineLearningBits

This repository contains a collection of notebooks that works as a cookbook of sorts - I have put together 
examples to show how many common tasks associated to the process of building a machine learning model can be accomplished.

Many of the examples showcased in this repository have been taken from Sebastian Raschka excellent book *Python Machine Learning*
